                I'm Kanaad Shetty. I'm deeply interested in artificial intelligence—the idea that
                you can have systems work for you and find patterns that you're unable to find is
                wildly fascinating to me. I also enjoy cooking (very amateur) and philosophy
                (good enough to keep me entertained), and losing myself in
                <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>,
                nodding my head sagely to things I only half understand.

                I'm a business analyst for the AI platform team at an IT services company. I find the
                work fascinating—discovering new and improved ways to use the newest technologies in AI,
                using LLMs and agentic capabilities to solve interesting business problems. We leverage
                tools like LangChain, CrewAI, and OpenAI SDK to build solutions that create measurable impact.

                My work spans product & strategy (translating business goals into AI use-cases, defining
                success metrics and OKRs) and requirements & design (writing clear specs for AI features,
                mapping data sources for RAG systems, ensuring safety and compliance). I help identify
                where GenAI and agentic solutions can meaningfully reduce manual effort, improve cycle
                times, and drive real business value.
